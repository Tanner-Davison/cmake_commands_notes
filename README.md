# CMake Command Reference

A comprehensive reference for essential CMake commands to assist in configuring, building, and managing your C++ projects.

## Basic CMake Commands

### Configure the Project
```bash
cmake -S . -B build
# -S .: Specifies the source directory (where CMakeLists.txt is located).
# -B build: Specifies the build directory where CMake will generate build files.

Build the Project
cmake --build build
# Compiles and builds your project using the build system generated by CMake.

Clean the Build
rm -rf build
# Manually deletes the build directory, allowing you to start fresh.

CMake Configuration Options
Set Build Type (Debug/Release)
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
# CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE can be set to Debug, Release, RelWithDebInfo, or MinSizeRel.

Set a Custom Compiler
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++
# Allows you to specify a custom compiler for C and C++.

Specify Installation Directory
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install
# Sets the directory where the project will be installed.

Testing and Packaging
Run Tests (if configured)
ctest
# Runs tests defined in your project.

Create a Package
cpack
# Packages your project according to the configuration specified in CMakeLists.txt.

Advanced Commands
Generate Compilation Database (for IDEs like VSCode)
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON
# Generates a compile_commands.json file in the build directory, useful for IDEs that support it.

Use Presets (CMake 3.19+)
cmake --preset debug
# Presets allow predefined configurations (e.g., debug, release) in a CMakePresets.json file.

Install the Project
cmake --install build
# Installs the project to the directory specified by CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.

Diagnostic Commands
Show Available CMake Variables
cmake -LAH
# Displays all available CMake cache variables, useful for debugging or configuring the project.

Check CMake Version
cmake --version
# Displays the installed version of CMake.

Display Help
cmake --help
# Shows a help message with commonly used commands and options.

Interactive Use
CMake GUI
cmake-gui
# Launches a graphical user interface for configuring CMake projects interactively.
