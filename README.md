A comprehensive reference for essential CMake commands to assist in configuring, building, and managing your C++ projects.

Created by: Tanner Davison

# 🛠️ Basic CMake Commands

### 🔧 Configure the Project
```bash
cmake -S . -B build
# -S .: Specifies the source directory (where CMakeLists.txt is located).
# -B build: Specifies the build directory where CMake will generate build files.
```
### 🏗️ Build the Project
```bash
cmake --build build
# Compiles and builds your project using the build system generated by CMake.
```
### 🧹 Clean the Build
```bash
rm -rf build
# Manually deletes the build directory, allowing you to start fresh.
```
### ⚙️ CMake Configuration Options
🛠️ Set Build Type (Debug/Release)
```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
# CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE can be set to Debug, Release, RelWithDebInfo, or MinSizeRel.
```
### 🧰 Set a Custom Compiler
```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++
# Allows you to specify a custom compiler for C and C++.
```
### 📂 Specify Installation Directory
```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install
# Sets the directory where the project will be installed.
```
 # 🧪 Testing and Packaging
### 🧪 Run Tests (if configured)
```bash
ctest
# Runs tests defined in your project.
```
### 📦 Create a Package
```bash
cpack
# Packages your project according to the configuration specified in CMakeLists.txt.
```
# 🚀 Advanced Commands
### 🛠️ Generate Compilation Database (for IDEs like VSCode)
```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON
# Generates a compile_commands.json file in the build directory, useful for IDEs that support it.
```
### 🎛️ Use Presets (CMake 3.19+)
```bash
cmake --preset debug
# Presets allow predefined configurations (e.g., debug, release) in a CMakePresets.json file.
```
### 📂 Install the Project
```bash
cmake --install build
# Installs the project to the directory specified by CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.
```
# 🧐 Diagnostic Commands
### 📋 Show Available CMake Variables
```bash
cmake -LAH
# Displays all available CMake cache variables, useful for debugging or configuring the project.
```
### 📝 Check CMake Version
```bash
cmake --version
# Displays the installed version of CMake.
```
### ❓ Display Help
```bash
cmake --help
# Shows a help message with commonly used commands and options.
```
# 🖥️ Interactive Use
### 🖼️ CMake GUI
```bash
cmake-gui
# Launches a graphical user interface for configuring CMake projects interactively.
```
